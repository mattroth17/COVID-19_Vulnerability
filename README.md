# COVID19-Vulnerability
ML models for predicting COVID-19 vulnerability on a county-level in the US

### Summary
Used county-level socioeconomic indicators (e.g. median household income, political leaning, population density) to predict extent of COVID-19 outbreaks in U.S. counties. Classify counties as either low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk. Developed four machine learning models: linear support vector classified, support vector classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest using `Sklearn` library.
